# Template-CodeOnly
This repo includes a minimal directory structure and set of files to preserve project code.


# Getting Started 
To initialize this template repo for your project, 

1. Go to https://github.com/gsa-oes/Template-CodeOnly (you are here!)
2. Click the green button to "Use this Template"
3. Name your new repo.  Use the form `NNNN-ABC-MyProjectDescription` 
    * `NNNN` is the four-digit project code
    * `ABC` is the agency abbreviation
    * `MyProjectDescription` is a very short project description in Pascal case
4. Change the name of the new `.Rproj` file from `Template-CodeOnly.Rproj` to `NNNN-ABC-MyProjectDescription.Rproj`
5. Edit the new `README.md` file.  Your `README` should describe your project, provide a guide to what's in your repo, etc.  (You can do this by clicking the pencil icon above, making changes, and confirming the changes at the bottom of the page.)  Include a link to the project's top-level `G:` drive folder.
6. Clone your new repo into your project's top-level `G:` drive folder.  
7. Delete all these template `README` instructions.

# Workflow
1. Store your code in `/code/`
2. Use high-quality filenames that are human- and machine-readable.  They should 
    * start with numbers, so that default ordering is correct `00-prelims.R`, `01-power-calcs.R`, etc.
    * do not have spaces
    * have informative names
    * separate words with `-` or `_` to enable human reading
3. Edit your code files as you normally would
4. Frequently commit and push the changes you make back up to GitHub
